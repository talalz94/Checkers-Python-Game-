# Checkers-Python-Game-

Checkers or Draughts is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. 

I created this game back in 2016 during my third semester for my Computational Thinking 2 course. I created the game in Python using it's tkinter graphics library.

Compile the Checkers.py file to play.
